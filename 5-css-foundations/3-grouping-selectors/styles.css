/*
I actually misunderstood how The Odin Project wanted me to tackle this - rather than doing the below, they wanted to do the following:
.blackButton, .yellowButton { [everything inside .allButtons] }
Functionally this looks the same on the front-end in this instance, but it won't always, so it's best to make sure to properly read things going forwards to make sure I'm giving exactly the right solution

.allButtons {
    font-size: 28px;
    font-family: Helvetica, "Times New Roman", sans-serif;
}

.blackButton {
    background-color: black;
    color: white;
}

.yellowButton {
    background-color: yellow;
}
